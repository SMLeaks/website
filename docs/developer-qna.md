**Hi Mechanics!**


We have collected and answered a lot of your questions!
The idea of this Q&A is to be informative and to not leave you hanging, while we are working on the next chapter.
We have focused on your most commonly asked questions, as well as a few fun ones.
Let us know if you would like us to do these Q&As from time to time in the comments below.

                    q: 'When is the next chapter update coming?',
                    a: "The honest answer is that we don't know yet. The next chapter is a big, ambitious update with a lot of new locations. New bots to fight. New interactive parts to craft with and new game mechanics. We don't want to commit to a release date just yet. If we did, we would be forced to cut corners later on. It would also stop us from adding new ideas that would make it better if they came up. We will make sure that the update is really fun to play and that it offers a lot of hours of playtime before we release it. It could be later this year or next year. But we are working on it as fast as we can, without cutting back on quality. A rough guess would be that we are 50% done. We will keep making dev blogs to keep you updated on our progress.",

                        The scrapyard biome shown in <a href="/devblog/13">Devblog 13</a> is not really scrapped, but it is put on hold for now.
                        The reason is that we took the story in a more interesting direction and the scrapyard didn&apos;t really fit as the next location.
                        However, it might be included in a later update.
                        We still have a lot of really great ideas for the scrapyard setting.

                  {
                    q: 'Why is Scrap Mechanic lagging sometimes? Are you planning on fixing the lag when 2 large creations touch?',
                    a: "We had an issue answering this question since it's pretty complex and hard to explain in depth without getting too technical. So we are glad it was brought up here, so we can try and give a longer and more in-depth response. First, it's important to say that Scrap Mechanic is a very difficult game to make. There are no limits to what you can do. At the same time, the game has physics and multiplayer as well. So it's a game that can always be improved and optimized. But since the beginning, we have been determined to grab the bull by the horns and stick to this path to create something unique and interesting. Scrap Mechanic is a game that runs on our own game engine. This is great since it gives us full control over a lot of things. But physics is running on a physics engine called Bullet Physics. Bullet Physics is an external, open-source physics engine that does all the physics calculations in Scrap Mechanic. The main issue right now is calculating the responses from constraints like the bearings and suspensions as well as from collisions. At the moment, all of these are taken into account at the same level of quality as when calculating the responses for each rigid composition of parts. This makes collision checks expensive, especially on complex creations with a lot of bearings and suspensions. When a complex creation merges with another complex creation through a collision, thatâ€™s when the lag can kick in. The way we could fix this as we move forward would be by digging into bullet physics and seeing if we could make less important physics calculations run less expensive calculations instead of having them all running on the same level as it is now. This is, however, a process that would take a lot of time to implement and would most likely slow down other content updates. Our priority now is to finish the next chapter. After that, we will most likely dig into this and see what we can do to push back the lag. The good news is that there are things we can still do to make it better! The bad news is that it will slow down development on other parts of the game. We know that many players would love us to dig into this and we hear you loud and clear.",

                    q: 'When are you going to make the size of the creative mode map the same as the Survival one?',
                    a: 'This is something that we can do. We just have to make it happen. It has not been a priority, but we have gotten a lot of requests for this so we might have to find the time.',

                    q: 'In the future, will there be a weather system? Storm, rain (maybe faster-growing crops when raining), waves on the sea, etc.',
                    a: "Yes! We actually were planning to add a new cloud system and weather with the Survival update. Unfortunately, we never got time to include it. It's very much possible that weather will be included in the next chapter since we already started doing some work on it.",

                    a: "Most likely not as it's an issue with the physics engine. However, we did add new steering settings to the level 5 Driver's seat with Survival, where if you press E on bearings connected to it, you can change the steering radius. Here, you can tweak and see if you can find a sweet spot where the glitch is not triggered. Maybe that could help a little.",

                    q: "Are we going to eventually get aerial and aquatic-specific parts? Thrusters work but they're not the best for flying smoothly.",
                    a: "We want to dedicate a future chapter for aerial and aquatic adventures. So we are saving aerodynamics and better water physics for that. That's mainly the reason why it's not in the game yet.",

                    a: 'Honestly. we just have to get around to including it. We also want mod makers to be able to do these things. We will try and find some time to give them some love. ',

                    a: "We are not sure why wheels slide when parked on a slant. It's something we will have to investigate. We think one reason is that the wheels have pretty low friction. This is done to make driving feel nice. But it possibly comes at the cost of the vehicle sliding around too much. We will look into that further.",

So we decided to work on our own game within the sandbox/survival genre. Back then, we always felt like you couldn't really do much with the things you built in Minecraft. So we wanted to make a game where you create machines that have motion and physics. Creations that can solve problems within a game world. That's how it started.",

We didn't expect the game to become a number 1 global top-seller on Steam when we hit the release button. We were overwhelmed with bug reports and requests from all the new players. It was a stressful time, but a happy one.",

                    a: "Great question! Scrap Mechanic has been in development since late 2011 when we started and released on Steam in 2016. This might sound like a crazy long time, but when we started working on Scrap Mechanic, game engines like Unity were mainly used for mobile games and Unreal Engine's license cost was too high for us at the time. So we decided to make the game in a free engine, called Ogre Engine. It ended up limiting us a lot during development, so we decided to make our own. During development, we have been working on a Scrap Mechanic and our own game engine at the same time. This has slowed things down a lot. But we are now at a stage where we are really happy with our tools and development is going a lot faster compared to before Survival's release. However, we are working on pretty big updates so it still doesn't mean that they will be dropping at a very fast rate. Good game development still takes a lot of time. Everything has to get designed, iterated, tested, and implemented.",

Then we try to find a lot of new ideas for interactive parts and progression within that. It's much more complicated than that, but that's how we start.",

                    q: 'What was Survival development like? What took so long? Did plans change while making the mode? How is it still in an unfinished state?',
                    a: 'The thing that took the longest was the work we had to do on our game engine in order to allow us to do everything we wanted. The good news is that we are at a stage now where we are very happy with it. That was mainly the thing slowing the development down. But no more!',

We, however, are a bit limited when adding things to Scrap Mechanic since everything has to fit the theme and have a meaning in the context of the game. We focus more on bigger updates while leaving a lot of space for mod makers to be creative.",
